                <p> When you buy a Charity NFT, you’re not simply buying an avatar or a provably-rare piece of art. You
                    are gaining membership access to a club whose combined goal is to make a difference in today’s
                    society through Charity.
                    Your Charity NFT can serve as your digital identity, and open digital doors
                    for you.<br><br>
                    We compile a list of charity organisations for each NFT collection that are able to cooperate
                    effectively
                    in solving one particular issue of today’s society, which is determined by the collection. At the
                    end of each month, 50% of the raised
                    funds are split equally between the charities, and the remaining funds will be used for researching
                    the best possible organisations to include in our collections and developing NFTs.
                    <br><br>
                    The Charity NFT
                    collectibles will be a token of your charity contributions as well your digital identity that grants
                    you access to charity discord channels.</p>

                <p>
                    Each NFT is unique and programmatically generated from over lots of possible traits, including
                    expression, headgear, clothing, and some logo of the charity. All images are unique, but some are
                    rarer than others.

                    The charity NFTs are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS. (See
                    Record and Proof.) Purchasing one costs 0.1 ETH.

                    To access members-only areas such as our Charity Discord channel, NFT holders will need to be signed
                    in their Metamask Wallet.
